# Image-Manipulation-and-Enhancement

<p>This program serves as an image editing tool for photographers, artists, and personal use. 
It was developed in June 2021 as a project for cs3500: Object Oriented Design at Northeastern 
University.</p>

<p>This document serves as a tool for understanding the design of this project, from a 
high level. For convenience, this document will mimic the package structure of the acutal
project, and at the end, we provide a UML diagram to understand the overall structure and 
interactions between elements of the project from a visual standpoint.</p>

# Our Design ðŸ“¦

## The <code>IIMEModel</code> interface

An interface to represent functions of an Image-Manipulation-Enhancement model. The functions enable
the developer/user to import/export images, apply operations to an image, and create Programmed
images.

### The <code>IStateTrackingIMEModel</code> interface

The <code>IStateTrackingIMEModel</code> interface enables the Model to track the state of images
using a history. This interface offers useful methods such as <code>undo()</code>/<code>
redo()</code>,
<code>save()</code>, and <code>retrieve()</code>. These methods allow the implementation to track
the state of images and to save and revert changes.

### The <code>StateTrackingModelImpl</code> class

The implementation of the Model class. The class implements the methods for applying operations,
saving image states, undoing/redoing operations, and importing/exporting images. The class applies
operations using the <code>IOperation</code> interface, and in order to implement a new operation,
an extension of the <code>IOperation</code> is all that's needed. Thus, the model can remain
unchanged while new operations are added.

## The <code>Matrix</code> package

### <code>IMatrix</code> Interface

The <code>IMatrix</code> interface is a generically typed interface that enables the developer to
create implementations of a Matrix using any Object or 'type'. The interface offers clever and
useful methods such as <code>map()</code> to map a function to all the values in a Matrix, <code>
fillWith(X entry)</code> to fill an entire Matrix with a single entry, as well as <code>
elementWiseOperation
()</code> to apply a BiFunction with values from 2 given Matrices.

### <code>AMatrix</code> Abstract class

The <code>AMatrix</code> class is abstract and implements many of the Matrix methods that are
universal to all Matrices regardless of the type of entries such as <code>getElement(int row, int
col)</code>, etc.

### <code>MatrixImpl</code> Class

Our implementation of a Matrix with a generic type. The class offers methods to build a Matrix in
multiple ways with its constructors.

## The <code>fileformat</code> package
### The <code>IFileFormat</code> interface
Provides a flexible way to adapt the import/export functionalities from the model. This interface's
implementations act as function objects with signatures
<ul>
<li>
<code>String -> I</code> for imports, where <code>I</code>
represents some representation of an image, and the given <code>String</code> represents the path
to import the file from</li>
<li>
<code>String, I -> File</code>, where again <code>I</code>
represents some representation of an image, and the given <code>String</code> represents the path
to import the file from.
</li>
</ul>
The advantage to this design is that if we want to import and export to new file types,
we can just add a class that implements this interface.

### The <code>PPMFile</code> class
Our implementation of the <code>IFileFormat</code> interface. Provides the ability to
import from a PPM file and export to a PPM file. When importing, this class
checks that the imported image is an actual PPM file ending in the  ".ppm" extension,
and when exporting, this class always adds ".ppm" to the end of the exported file.

## The <code>Image</code> package

### <code>IImage</code> Interface

The <code>IImage</code> interface is a representation of an image. It offers methods that an Image
class can use for manipulation and observing. The interface offers a method to get the Matrix of
pixels and to create a copy of the image.

### <code>ImageImpl</code> Class

Our implementation of an <code>IImage</code>. It offers being able to create an Image object with a
Matrix of pixels or a nested Arraylist of pixels. The class also offers methods to observe
properties of the Image such as <code>copy()</code>, <code>equals()</code>,
<code>getPixelArray()</code>, etc.

## The <code>operation</code> package

### The <code>IOperation</code> interface

The interface that all operations will implement. It offers the basic functionality of applying an
operation to an image.

### The <code>IFilter</code> interface

The interface for all Filtering Operations. Offers methods for Filters to utilize such as applying
to all or a single color channel.

### The <code>AFilter</code> abstract class

The abstract class to abstract methods that all filters will extend. This class deals with the heavy
lifting for a convolution approach to applying a kernel matrix to every pixel in the image. The
abstract class dynamically implements the kernel to the image depending on its size.

### The <code>ImageBlur</code> and <code>Sharpening</code> class

Implementations of <code>AFilter</code>, the classes provide their respective kernels, and the
abstract class handles their application. This implementation allows us to easily add new filters by
simply creating a new class to extend <code>AFilter</code>, and then implementing a method to
provide its respective kernel.

### The <code>IColorTransform</code> interface

The interface for all Color Transform operations. Offers methods for a color transform to use such
as applying to all channels at once.

### The <code>AColorTransform</code> abstract class

The abstract class to abstract methods that all color transforms will extend. This class deals with
the convolution for applying a matrix multiplication to each channel for every pixel. The abstract
class dynamically implements the kernel to the image depending on its size.

### The <code>Greyscale</code> and <code>Sepia</code> class

Implementations of <code>AColorTransform</code>, the classes provide their respective kernels, and
the abstract class handles their application. This implementation allows us to easily add new color
transformations by simply creating a new class to extend <code>AColorTransform</code>, and then
implementing a method to provide its respective kernel.

## The <code>Pixel</code> package

### The <code>IPixel</code> interface

The interface to represent the implementation for a pixel. The interface offers the observers for
the pixel's implementation.

### The <code>PixelImpl</code> class

The implementation for an <code>IPixel</code>. The class utilizes a <code>Channel</code> object to
represent the color channels for a pixel. The class implements the interface's methods and also
offers the overriden methods: <code>equals()</code>, <code>hashCode()</code>, and
<code>toString()</code>.

## The <code>Channel</code> package

### The <code>IChannel</code> interface

The interface to represent a color channel. A color channel has an intensity value that is enforced
to be within the range <code>[0,255]</code>, in addition to the channel's label: such as RED,GREEN,
and BLUE.

### The <code>ChannelImpl</code> class

The implementation of the <code>IChannel</code> interface. Implements the methods from the interface
to observe the properties of the Channel. The class also enforces the range for the intensity of the
channel within the constructor.

## The <code>ProgrammaticImages</code> package

### The <code>IProgamImage</code> interface

The interface for all programmatic images. Offers a construct method for subclasses to build their
programmatic images.

### The <code>Noise</code>,<code>PureNoise</code>, <code>RainbowNoise</code>, <code>BWNoise</code>, and the <code>Checkerboard</code> class

The subclasses to represent a specific programmatic image. Each class constructs its programmatic
image with a unit size, specified in the <code>setProgrammaticImage()</code> method in the model
class.

## The <code>Utils</code> class

A class with helpful methods to be utilized throughout the program. Includes many methods to
simplify complicated methods such as enforcing an integer to be within a range, checking for
nullness, etc.
