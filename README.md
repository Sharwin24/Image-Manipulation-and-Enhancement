# Image-Manipulation-and-Enhancement

<p>This program serves as an image editing tool for photographers, artists, and personal use. 
It was developed in June 2021 as a project for CS3500: Object Oriented Design at Northeastern 
University.</p>

<p>This document serves as a tool for understanding the design of this project, from a 
high level. For convenience, this document will mimic the package structure of the acutal
project, and at the end, we provide a UML diagram to understand the overall structure and 
interactions between elements of the project from a visual standpoint.</p>
