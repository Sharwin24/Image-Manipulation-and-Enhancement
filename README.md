# Image-Manipulation-and-Enhancement

<p>This program serves as an image editing tool for photographers, artists, and personal use. 
It was developed in June 2021 as a project for cs3500: Object Oriented Design at Northeastern 
University.</p>

<p>This document serves as a tool for understanding the design of this project, from a 
high level. For convenience, this document will mimic the package structure of the acutal
project, and at the end, we provide a UML diagram to understand the overall structure and 
interactions between elements of the project from a visual standpoint.</p>

# Design Philosophy

The center goal of creating an image processor with capabilities to apply operations to an image was
only one aspect of this project. The other aspect(arguably more important too) was to build a
framework and design that enabled the developers to easily make modifications to the project in the
future in addition to outside developers being able to easily extend features for their own
implementations. An important step was to take a highly abstract approach to designing
implementations for what an image, operation, a pixel, etc. represent.

# Project Packages ðŸ“¦

# The <code>Model</code> package

### The <code>IIMEModel</code> interface

An interface to represent functions of an Image-Manipulation-Enhancement model. The functions enable
the developer/user to import/export images, apply operations to an image, and create Programmed
images.

### The <code>IStateTrackingIMEModel</code> interface

The <code>IStateTrackingIMEModel</code> interface enables the Model to track the state of images
using a history. This interface offers useful methods such as <code>undo()</code>/<code>
redo()</code>,
<code>save()</code>, and <code>getImage()</code>. These methods allow the implementation to track
the state of images and to save and revert changes.

### The <code>StateTrackingModelImpl</code> class

The implementation of the Model class. The class implements the methods for applying operations,
saving image states, undoing/redoing operations, and importing/exporting images. The class applies
operations using the <code>IOperation</code> interface, and in order to implement a new operation,
an extension of the <code>IOperation</code> is all that's needed. Thus, the model can remain
unchanged while new operations are added.

### The <code>IMultiLayerModel</code> interface

The <code>IMultiLayerModel</code> interface is an extension of the
<code>IStateTrackingIMEModel</code> interface. It also offers the ability to maintain multiple
layers for a group of images to be edited separately. The interface offers methods to edit a layer's
image, to add/remove/swap and get layers. It also provides functionality to set the current working
layer.

### The <code>IMultiLayerExtraOperations</code> interface

An extension of the <code>IMultiLayerModel</code> interface. Offers the same utility as the <code>
IMultiLayerModel</code> interface in addition to the functionality of being able to apply a mosaic
and downscale operation to an image in the model. The downscale operations applies to all layers in
the <code>IMultiLayerModel</code> model.

### The <code>MultiLayerModelImpl</code> class

The implementation of the MultiLayerModel interface. This class implements the interface's methods
and offers its use to the user.

### The <code>MockMultiLayerModel</code> class

A mock model for testing the <code>MultiLayerModelImpl</code> implementation. Utilizes a log to
track all method calls within the mock.

## The <code>Matrix</code> package

### <code>IMatrix</code> Interface

The <code>IMatrix</code> interface is a generically typed interface that enables the developer to
create implementations of a Matrix using any Object or 'type'. The interface offers clever and
useful methods such as <code>map()</code> to map a function to all the values in a Matrix, <code>
fillWith(X entry)</code> to fill an entire Matrix with a single entry, as well as <code>
elementWiseOperation
()</code> to apply a BiFunction with values from 2 given Matrices.

### <code>AMatrix</code> Abstract class

The <code>AMatrix</code> class is abstract and implements many of the Matrix methods that are
universal to all Matrices regardless of the type of entries such as <code>getElement(int row, int
col)</code>, etc.

### <code>MatrixImpl</code> Class

Our implementation of a Matrix with a generic type. The class offers methods to build a Matrix in
multiple ways with its constructors.

## The <code>Fileformat</code> package

### The <code>IFileFormat</code> interface

Provides a flexible way to adapt the import/export functionalities from the model. This interface's
implementations act as function objects with signatures
<ul>
<li>
<code>String -> I</code> for imports, where <code>I</code>
represents some representation of an image, and the given <code>String</code> represents the path
to import the file from</li>
<li>
<code>String, I -> File</code>, where again <code>I</code>
represents some representation of an image, and the given <code>String</code> represents the path
to import the file from.
</li>
</ul>
The advantage to this design is that if we want to import and export to new file types,
we can just add a class that implements this interface.

### The <code>PPMFile</code> class

Our implementation of the <code>IFileFormat</code> interface. Provides the ability to import from a
PPM file and export to a PPM file. When importing, this class checks that the imported image is an
actual PPM file ending in the  ".ppm" extension, and when exporting, this class always adds ".ppm"
to the end of the exported file.

## The <code>Image</code> package

### <code>IImage</code> Interface

The <code>IImage</code> interface is a representation of an image. It offers methods that an Image
class can use for manipulation and observing. The interface offers a method to get the Matrix of
pixels and to create a copy of the image.

### <code>ImageImpl</code> Class

Our implementation of an <code>IImage</code>. It offers being able to create an Image object with a
Matrix of pixels or a nested Arraylist of pixels. The class also offers methods to observe
properties of the Image such as <code>copy()</code>, <code>equals()</code>,
<code>getPixelArray()</code>, etc.

## The <code>Operation</code> package

### The <code>IOperation</code> interface

The interface that all operations will implement. It offers the basic functionality of applying an
operation to an image.

### The <code>IFilter</code> interface

The interface for all Filtering Operations. Offers methods for Filters to utilize such as applying
to all or a single color channel.

abstract class handles their application. This implementation allows us to easily add new filters by
simply creating a new class to extend <code>AFilter</code>, and then implementing a method to
provide its respective kernel.

### The <code>IColorTransform</code> interface

The interface for all Color Transform operations. Offers methods for a color transform to use such
as applying to all channels at once.

### The <code>AColorTransform</code> abstract class

The abstract class to abstract methods that all color transforms will extend. This class deals with
the convolution for applying a matrix multiplication to each channel for every pixel. The abstract
class dynamically implements the kernel to the image depending on its size.

### The <code>Greyscale</code> and <code>Sepia</code> class

Implementations of <code>AColorTransform</code>, the classes provide their respective kernels, and
the abstract class handles their application. This implementation allows us to easily add new color
transformations by simply creating a new class to extend <code>AColorTransform</code>, and then
implementing a method to provide its respective kernel.

represent the color channels for a pixel. The class implements the interface's methods and also
offers the overriden methods: <code>equals()</code>, <code>hashCode()</code>, and
<code>toString()</code>.

## The <code>Channel</code> package

### The <code>IChannel</code> interface

to be within the range <code>[0,255]</code>, in addition to the channel's label: such as RED,GREEN,
and BLUE.

### The <code>ChannelImpl</code> class

The implementation of the <code>IChannel</code> interface. Implements the methods from the interface
to observe the properties of the Channel. The class also enforces the range for the intensity of the
channel within the constructor.

# The <code>Controller</code> Package

## The <code>IMultiLayerIMEController</code> interface

The <code>IMultiLayerIMEController</code> interface offers the functionality to run a program
interacting with the model and the view. The implementation of this class will need to accept user
input in order to perform actions in the model and the view.

## The <code>MultiLayerIMEControllerImpl</code> class

## How to use the GUI <a name="gui"></a>
<p>In the <code>GUIController</code> and <code>GUIView</code> classes, support is added for a 
Graphical User Interface (GUI) that supports all of the functionality of the model, as well as some 
extra features. Almost all functionality is exposed through dropdown menus, while some functionality
is also exposed through on-screen buttons, interactive text areas, or a combination.</p>
<p>In general, interactable elements such as menu items and buttons that have
"...", such as the button <code>Foo...</code>
indicate that this action will require extra input from the user, usually obtained through a popup 
window. The following 
provides a brief summary of all of the functionalities of the GUI and how they can be used:</p>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>
<b>The <i>File</i> menu</b>
<ul>
<li>
The <i>Import</i> submenu</li>
<ul>
<li><i>Import a multi-layered image</i> imports a group of layers--JPG/JPEG, PNG, or PPM files
from a file explorer/finder (for Windows/MacOS)-- referenced in a text file
that contains the absolute path of all of the images that are to be imported, one on each line.
An example is a file <i>images.txt</i> with contents 
<code>C:\Users\Joe\JoesImages\image1.png</code> <br> 
<code>C:\Users\Sally\SallysImages\dogImage.jpg</code> <br>
<code>D:\FancyBear\Images\russianFlag.ppm</code> <br> 
<code>C:\Sys\Images\Logo.jpeg</code></li>
<li><i>import one image</i> imports one JPG/JPEG, PNG, or PPM file 
from a file explorer/finder (for Windows/MacOS)</li>
</ul>
<li>The <i>Export</i> submenu</li> <ul>
<li><i>Export one image</i> exports the currently visibile layer to a given destination
via a file explorer/finder (for Windows/MacOS), as a PPM, PNG, or JPEG/PNG file</li>
<li>
<i>Export a multi-layered image</i> exports all **visible** layers to a folder with 
a name specified by the user. This folder contains a text file like the one describe in the 
<i>import all</i> section, as well as the images themselves.</li></ul></ul>
</li>
<li>The <i>Edit</i> menu</li>
<ul>
<li><i>Undo</i> undoes the most recent transformation applied to the current layer (see <i>
Transformations menu</i>).</li>
<li><i>Redo</i> redoes the most recent transformation undone from the current layer (see <i>
Transformations menu</i>).</li>
<li><i>New Layer</i> creates a new layer that comes after all of the preexisting layers. This layer
is visible and contains no image. Note that this layer is not set as the current, just created.</li>
<li><i>Set current layer...</i> asks the user to enter the layer number to switch to, and sets that 
layer as the current working layer.</li>
<li><i>Delete layer...</i> asks the user to enter the layer number to delete, and deletes that 
layer.</li></ul>

<li>The <i>Transformations</i> menu</li>
<ul>
<li><i>Sepia</i> applies a sepia filter to the current working layer.</li>
<li><i>Greyscale</i> applies a greyscale filter to the current working layer.</li>
<li><i>Blur</i> applies a blur filter to the current working layer.</li>
<li><i>Sharpen</i> applies a sharpen filter to the current working layer.</li>
<li><i>Mosaic...</i> asks the user to enter the number of seeds to mosaic the image with and then 
applies a mosaic filter to the current working layer with that number of seeds. The number of
seeds indicates how large 'clusters', or the stained-glass-looking pieces that result from the 
mosaic filter should be. A higher seed number will result in smaller, more ubiquitous clusters, 
while a smaller seed number will result in larger clusters that are fewer in size.</li>
<li><i>Downscale...</i> asks the user to enter a new width and height (smaller than the current width 
 height) to set the new dimensions as. This transformation is then applied to **all** layers that
are being worked on, since all layers must be of the same size.</li>
</ul>

<li>The <i>Programmatic images</i> menu</li>
<ul>
<li><i>Checkerboard...</i> asks the user for a width, height, and square size (all in pixels) for 
for the checkerboard image and then displays the checkerboard image on the current working layer.</li>
<li>The <i>Noise</i> submenu: all commands in this menu ask the user for the width and 
height of the noise image to be created, then display that noise image on the current working layer.
<ul>
<li><i>Pure noise...</i> creates a noise image where each pixel's color is completely randomized.
</li>
<li><i>Black and white noise...</i> creates a noise image where each pixel is either black or white.
</li>
<li>
<i>Rainbow noise...</i> creates a noise image where each pixel is either red, orange, yellow, 
green, blue, indigo, or violet--the colors of the rainbow.</li>
<li><i>Custom...</i> opens a color picker and allows the user to choose as many colors as they want
to be included in a noise image. Once the user is done picking colors, their specified noise image
is generated.</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<li>The <i>Theme</i> menu sets a color theme for the GUI. Currently, there are
four themes: <i>Light, Dark, Matrix, </i> and <i>Retro</i>. Try them out!</li>

<li>The <i>Help</i> menu provides resources for how to use the program. Currently, the
<i>View GitHub Source</i> item links to the README and USEME files contained in this project on 
its source on GitHub, since the repository is private. You likely opened this document using this
menu item. If you did, hello! Nice to see you here.</li>
</ul>
 </li>
 </ul></p>

<p>
The following provides a summary of the other non-menu based features of the GUI:
<ul>
<li>
On the left side of the GUI, there is an area that is titled <i>LAYERS</i>,
and provides a graphical view of the layers that are being edited. Each layer has a 
button that can be clicked to switch to that layer. Each layer also has a button
to delete that layer, as well as a checkbox that makes the image visible when checked,
and invisible when unchecked. Furthermore, the <i>New Layer</i> and <i>Swap Layers</i>
buttons can be used to do exactly what they describe, where the swap layers button asks the user to
input the two layer numbers to be swapped.</li>
<li> On the right side of the GUI, there is an area entitled <i>Type script here</i>,
where the user can type a script (see the <i>How to write scripts</i> section of this document for 
details). The user can draft a script from scratch in this area, then press the 
<i>Run Script</i> button to run it, or use the <i>Load Script</i> button to 
load a script file (a .txt file) from any directory in their computer into the scriptable area, then 
proceed to edit and/or run it. This script must conform to the syntax described in the
<i>How to write scripts</i> section of this document.</li>
<li>
Finally, there is a read-only console area in the bottom of the GUI. This provides 
helpful messages to the user to update them on the status of operations being performed.</li>
</ul></p>

## How to write scripts <a name="scripts"></a>

<p>In the <code>MultiLayerIIMEControllerImpl</code> class, inputs are processed from the a <code> Readable</code> with the following
syntax:
 <p> Each command follows this meta-syntax:
 <i><code>[CMD] [arg1] [arg2] ... [argn]</code></i>,
 where <code>[CMD]</code> is the textual representation of a command, and where
 <code>[argi]</code> is the <code>i</code>th required argument of a function of arity
 <code>n</code>. Additionally, some commands take an optional parameter, denoted with the syntax
 <code>(opt)</code>, where the use of parentheses distinguish that this parameter is optional and
 not <code>[required]</code>. Furthermore, this controller takes advantage of <code> IIMECommand</code>
 function objects associated with each textual command via a <code> Map</code> in order to easily
 support this functionality, and provide developers with an easy path to add/change the supported
 commands. Since different commands have different arities (and some take no optional paramters),
 the commands take arguments as expressed in the following table. Consider this a <i>guide</i> to
 using the commands, too</p>
 <p><b>How to read the guide:</b></p> the <i>textual command</i> shows
 what word leads off a command, and the <i>parameters</i> shows what parameters should be
 specified, where:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>[Type]</code> denotes a required parameter of type <code>Type</code>,
        for example, <code>[String]</code> represents a required parameter
        that is a String.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>(Type)</code> denotes an optional parameter of type <code>Type</code>,
        for example, for parameters <code>[Integer] (Real) [Boolean]</code>,
        a valid command combination of parameters would be <code>0 12.3 true</code>,
       or <code>0 true</code>, since the <code>(Real)</code> optional parameter is, well, optional.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>("literal")</code> and <code>["literal"]</code> denote
        an optional or required (resp.) parameter that is the literal value
        <code>literal</code>, as denoted by the quotation marks. For example,
        for parameters <code>[String] (Integer) ("5") ["hello"]</code>,
        valid combinations of parameters would be <code>Foo 2 5 hello</code>,
        <code>bar 5 hello</code>, or <code>BAZ hello</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>[{t1, t2, ..., tn}]</code> and
        <code>({t1, t2, ..., tm})</code>
        denote a parameter that can be one of the literals <code>ti</code>,
        where <code>1 <= i <= n,m</code>, and <code>n != m || n == m</code>, in
        a required or optional parameter (resp.). For example, for parameters
        <code>[Character] ({1, 2, 3}) [{Foo, Bar, Baz, Quux}]</code>,
        a valid combination of parameters is <code>A 2 Quux</code>,
        <code>u Baz</code>, but not <code>f 4 Hello</code>, since
        "4" and "Hello" are not enumerated in
        <code>({1, 2, 3})</code> and <code>[{Foo, Bar, Baz, Quux}]</code>, (
        resp.)
      </li>
    </ul>

   <ul>
     <ul>
       <li>
       <b>Textual command:</b> <code>apply</code>
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           <b>Arity:</b> n-ary
         </li>
         <li>
           <b>Parameters:</b>

         <li><b>Description:</b> applies <code>n</code>

<p><b><u>RULES:</u></b>
<ul>
<li>
There is only one command per line</li>
<li>
After a valid command is processed, the rest of the line is ignored</li>
<li>Invalid commands are ignored</li></ul></p>
<p><b><u>Example Scripts:</u></b> <br>
In the <code>/scripts</code> folder there are multiple example
scripts that can be used to control the IME program. Here, we give a brief commentary of what they
do. To view these scripts without comments, see the
