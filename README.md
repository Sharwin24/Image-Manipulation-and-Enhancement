# Image-Manipulation-and-Enhancement

<p>This program serves as an image editing tool for photographers, artists, and personal use. 
It was developed in June 2021 as a project for cs3500: Object Oriented Design at Northeastern 
University.</p>

<p>This document serves as a tool for understanding the design of this project, from a 
high level. For convenience, this document will mimic the package structure of the acutal
project, and at the end, we provide a UML diagram to understand the overall structure and 
interactions between elements of the project from a visual standpoint.</p>

# Design Philosophy

The center goal of creating an image processor with capabilities to apply operations to an image was
only one aspect of this project. The other aspect(arguably more important too) was to build a
framework and design that enabled the developers to easily make modifications to the project in the
future in addition to outside developers being able to easily extend features for their own
implementations. An important step was to take a highly abstract approach to designing
implementations for what an image, operation, a pixel, etc. represent.

# Project Packages ðŸ“¦

# The <code>Model</code> package

### The <code>IIMEModel</code> interface

An interface to represent functions of an Image-Manipulation-Enhancement model. The functions enable
the developer/user to import/export images, apply operations to an image, and create Programmed
images.

### The <code>IStateTrackingIMEModel</code> interface

The <code>IStateTrackingIMEModel</code> interface enables the Model to track the state of images
using a history. This interface offers useful methods such as <code>undo()</code>/<code>
redo()</code>,
<code>save()</code>, and <code>getImage()</code>. These methods allow the implementation to track
the state of images and to save and revert changes.

### The <code>StateTrackingModelImpl</code> class

The implementation of the Model class. The class implements the methods for applying operations,
saving image states, undoing/redoing operations, and importing/exporting images. The class applies
operations using the <code>IOperation</code> interface, and in order to implement a new operation,
an extension of the <code>IOperation</code> is all that's needed. Thus, the model can remain
unchanged while new operations are added.

### The <code>IMultiLayerModel</code> package

The <code>IMultiLayerModel</code> interface is an extension of the
<code>IStateTrackingIMEModel</code> interface. It also offers the ability to maintain multiple
layers for a group of images to be edited separately. The interface offers methods to edit a layer's
image, to add/remove/swap and get layers. It also provides functionality to set the current working
layer.

### The <code>MultiLayerModelImpl</code> class

The implementation of the MultiLayerModel interface. This class implements the interface's methods
and offers its use to the user.

## The <code>Matrix</code> package

### <code>IMatrix</code> Interface

The <code>IMatrix</code> interface is a generically typed interface that enables the developer to
create implementations of a Matrix using any Object or 'type'. The interface offers clever and
useful methods such as <code>map()</code> to map a function to all the values in a Matrix, <code>
fillWith(X entry)</code> to fill an entire Matrix with a single entry, as well as <code>
elementWiseOperation
()</code> to apply a BiFunction with values from 2 given Matrices.

### <code>AMatrix</code> Abstract class

The <code>AMatrix</code> class is abstract and implements many of the Matrix methods that are
universal to all Matrices regardless of the type of entries such as <code>getElement(int row, int
col)</code>, etc.

### <code>MatrixImpl</code> Class

Our implementation of a Matrix with a generic type. The class offers methods to build a Matrix in
multiple ways with its constructors.

## The <code>fileformat</code> package

### The <code>IFileFormat</code> interface

Provides a flexible way to adapt the import/export functionalities from the model. This interface's
implementations act as function objects with signatures
<ul>
<li>
<code>String -> I</code> for imports, where <code>I</code>
represents some representation of an image, and the given <code>String</code> represents the path
to import the file from</li>
<li>
<code>String, I -> File</code>, where again <code>I</code>
represents some representation of an image, and the given <code>String</code> represents the path
to import the file from.
</li>
</ul>
The advantage to this design is that if we want to import and export to new file types,
we can just add a class that implements this interface.

### The <code>PPMFile</code> class

Our implementation of the <code>IFileFormat</code> interface. Provides the ability to import from a
PPM file and export to a PPM file. When importing, this class checks that the imported image is an
actual PPM file ending in the  ".ppm" extension, and when exporting, this class always adds ".ppm"
to the end of the exported file.

## The <code>Image</code> package

The <code>IImage</code> interface is a representation of an image. It offers methods that an Image
class can use for manipulation and observing. The interface offers a method to get the Matrix of
pixels and to create a copy of the image.

Matrix of pixels or a nested Arraylist of pixels. The class also offers methods to observe
properties of the Image such as <code>copy()</code>, <code>equals()</code>,
<code>getPixelArray()</code>, etc.

as applying to all channels at once.

the convolution for applying a matrix multiplication to each channel for every pixel. The abstract
class dynamically implements the kernel to the image depending on its size.

### The <code>Greyscale</code> and <code>Sepia</code> class

Implementations of <code>AColorTransform</code>, the classes provide their respective kernels, and

programmatic images.
